The aim of the project is to implement the [Santorini](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/santorini/) game following the model of Model View Controller for the realization of the model according to the object-oriented programming paradigm. The final result completely covers the rules defined by the game and allows you to interact with a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical interface (GUI), the network has been managed with the traditional socket approach.

## Documentation
The following documentation includes the documents created for the design of the problem, first of all the UML diagram will be listed then the documentation of the code (javadoc).

### UML

The following class diagrams represent the first, the model according to which the game should have been implemented, the second instead contains the final product diagrams in the critical parts found.
- [Initials UML](https://github.com/)
- [Final UML](https://github.com/)

### JavaDoc
The following documentation includes a description for most of the classes and methods used, it follows Java documentation techniques and can be consulted at the following address: [Javadoc](https://github.com/)
